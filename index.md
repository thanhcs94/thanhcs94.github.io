I'm an software engineer and aspiring Android developer. How I ended up on this path is a long story.
Currently, I'm investing my time into learning about mobile development (specifically Android) because I think it has vast amount of potential still hidden within it. I'm grateful for the events that have taken place to put me on this road. It was a rough start, but I know this moment going forward will be truly amazing !
